# SAP Workbech README

## My very first extension

This is my first extension/theme that I just created just for my use, but feel free to use, change, do whatever you want.
I wanted to bring VSCode closer to my SAP Workbench, make coding a more SAP-like experience, which I really enjoy. Hope you enjoy this simplistic attempt to achieve it.
I'm using it to create my codes in Javascript, UI5, Fiori, XML trying to use color that don't cause too much fadigue and be pleasant at the same time.
BTW, I'm very newbie in UI5, Javascript, XML and this world is captiving me every single day.

* This theme is based on SAP Signature Colors.
* Some changes were made in this theme to adapt it to the vast amount of options that these languages ​​offer.
* There colors used in SAP Workbench, color from SAP BTP and few "improvisations" that I made by my self.

## more...

* _I hope I'm not breaking any rights by using SAP name, sorry if I did._

## About me
Well..

_**The code**, the final frontier\
These are the voyages of Ivan Milazzotti\

Its more than 15 year mission\
To explore strange new tecnologies\
To seek out new languages\
And new chanllenges\
To boldly go where almost all of you already gone before..._
